// Detach makes a node self-sufficient: it absorbs the history prefix it
// currently reads through an ancestor, and stops pointing at one.
//
// This is what a delete owes a BOUNDARY SURVIVOR — an aria outside the
// delete set whose lineage runs through it. Once every such survivor has
// detached, the doomed directories carry nothing anyone still reads and can
// be unlinked.
//
// Crash-safe and idempotent by ordering, with no journal: the absorbed
// records are written FIRST, as segments below the node's own fork base,
// where every read still delegates to the ancestor and so cannot see them.
// Only the marker flip publishes them, and that is a rename. Crash before
// it and the node still reads through its ancestor, with some ignored files
// that the next Detach overwrites; crash after and it is independent.
//
// Copy, not adopt: it touches nothing the ancestor owns and nothing the
// node's own writer is using, so it needs no quiesce. Adopting the
// ancestor's directory would be cheaper in bytes and would require one.
