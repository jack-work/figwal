// flatten.go: the v3 -> v4 layout migration.
//
// A v3 store nested a node inside its parent's directory, so lineage WAS the
// path: ir/config@6bd4/n4/n6 read n6 as a child of n4. A v4 store puts every
// node at depth 1 and records lineage in the node's own .node marker.
//
// The flat build cannot open a nested store, and does not say so: Index
// RebuildFrom reads ONE directory, and a v3 node carries neither .node nor
// .from, so it is skipped as an unfinished fork. A real store opens
// "successfully" with its loadout stumps and none of its conversations.
// That silence is why this migration must run before anything walks.
//
// It moves directories and writes markers. No record is parsed, no log is
// opened, and NO FORK BASE IS EVER READ OR WRITTEN. An LT does not change
// when a directory moves: a base is relative to the parent's numbering, the
// parent keeps its own segments, and .node names the same parent the nesting
// did. Recomputing a base here would be a misunderstanding, not a repair.
