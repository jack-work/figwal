// RenameChannel renames a channel on disk: its directory under root, and its
// entry in the manifest. It is for a CONSUMER's migration — figaro renaming its
// form channel — and it is here rather than there because the manifest is
// figwal's private format, and old-format knowledge belongs in the code that
// owns the format.
//
// It must run with the store CLOSED. There is no lock to take: an open store
// holds file handles on the directory being moved, and on the manifest it would
// then be told to disbelieve. The caller runs it in the same place a layout
// migration runs, before anything opens the store.
//
// It is idempotent in the useful direction. A store already renamed (no `from`
// in the manifest, `to` present) reports nothing to do rather than failing, so a
// migration that dies between the move and the manifest write can be re-run:
// the directory move happens first and the manifest is repaired second, and
// either half alone is recognised.
//
// The reducer NAME travels with the channel when it matched the old channel
// name. A reducer is resolved by its own name first and the channel's second
// (resolveReducer), so a channel called "x" with reducer "x" renamed to "y"
// must look for "y" — otherwise the consumer registers its reducer under the
// new name and the open fails with "no reducer registered", which is exactly
// the failure this whole migration exists to avoid.
